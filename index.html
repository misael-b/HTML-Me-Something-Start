            <h3>Club Carrer</h3>
               <h4>Cosmos Jr.</h4>
                  <p>
                     Misael started his soccer career at the age of 10 years old. He joined local club Cosmos Jrs. after hearing about it 
                     from classmate Marcos. It would be here that he would consolidate himself as a defender, specifically playing at right
                     back. During the first season, they would end the season undefeated winning the league. The following year would not 
                     turn out to have the same ending. They would start the season off winning their first few games. It would not be until
                     they played Lightning, a new team to the league. They would suffer their first loss and would end the season second in the 
                     league.

               <h4>Pattonville Freshman Team</h4>
                  <p>
                     After a couple of years of not playing for a team, Misael would be entering highschool and in hopes of joining the freshman team.
                     He would spend all summer training with his childhood friend Jacob with the aim of not only making the team, but being one of the 
                     starters of the team. All the hard work would pay off for the both of them as they made the team and were starters for the whole season. 
                     The season would end with a win against rival team Ritneor.

                  <p>
                     The next year, Misael would play for the JV team. He was one of the 20 people that made the team from the original 30 players that tried out.
                     The season would end with a record of 10 wins and 9 loses. It would be in a 10-0 win against McCluer that Misael would score his first goal.

                  <p>
                     The final team Misael played for was the Varsity team. He would again play in his normal position of right back. Although there would be a lot 
                     of close games, they would end the season with 13 wins, 17 loses, and 2 draws. Of those wins, they would again beat rival team, Ritneor, 2-0 at home

            <h3>Retirement</h3>
               <p>
                  After Misael's last game for his highschool he would go on to play for an indoor team he and his friends made. In the first season 
                  they would end up making it to the final. In a heated and dramatic game they would end in a penalty shoot out where they would be 
                  defeated. The team would sign up for a second season and would become chamnpions. Misael now plays soccer occationally and spends 
                  a lot more time in the gym working out. He has also just began to play golf and is taking classes to become a web developer.
