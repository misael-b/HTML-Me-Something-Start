                  Misael Barcenas was born on May 10, 1998 in Chicago, IL. During his childhood he would move to St.Louis, MO where he
                  would develop a passion for soccer. He would spend every afternoon playing soccer on the street with his two brothers in
                  hopes of one day becoming a professional soccer player. He grew up supporting the Mexican soccer team Club Deportivo
                  Guadalajara (Chivas).

                     Misael started his soccer career at the age of 10 years old. He joined local club Cosmos Jrs. after hearing about it
                     from a classmate, Marcos. It would be here that he would consolidate himself as a defender, specifically playing at
                     right back. During the first season, the team would end the season undefeated winning the league. The following year
                     would not turn out to have the same ending. They would start the season off winning their first few games. Their next
                     opponent was Lightning, a new team to the league. They would suffer their first loss and would end the season second in
                     the league.

                     being one of the starters of the team. All the hard work would pay off for the both of them as they made the team and
                     were starters for the whole season. The season would end with a win against rival highschool team Ritenour.

                  After Misael's last game for his highschool team he would go on to play for an indoor team he and his friends made. In
                  the first season they would end up making it to the final. In a heated and dramatic game they would end in a penalty
                  shoot out where they would be defeated. The team would sign up for a second season and would become champions. Misael
                  now plays soccer very rarely and spends a lot more time in the gym working out. He has also just begun to play golf and
                  is taking classes to become a web developer.
